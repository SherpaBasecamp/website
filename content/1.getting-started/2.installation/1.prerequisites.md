The few little packages needed before installing.

## Almost nothing

- **Bash** obviously. Your package manager have it, and most of the times you already have it.

- **curl** to get remote data. Quite common too. Type `curl --version` and if needed, install it.

- **gawk** required by shdoc. Used during `sherpa build` commands to generate docs.

--- The Installer script will do the rest! ---

## or Do It Yourself

- Install curl via your package manager command, but should be installed already.

- Install webi from [https://webinstall.dev](https://webinstall.dev)

```bash
curl -sS https://webi.sh/webi | sh; \
source ~/.config/envman/PATH.env
```

- Install tools via webi, if not already installed

```bash
webi git rustlang pathman aliasman yq jq shellcheck shfmt
```

- Install `gawk` via package manager for shdoc, then:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc
cd shdoc
sudo make install
```

- Install bashunit via curl

```bash
curl -s https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/install.sh | bash
```
