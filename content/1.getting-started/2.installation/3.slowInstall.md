Be sure you alreay installed the prerequisites, if not, read the [installation](/getting-started/installation/prerequisites) page.

## Manual Install

To make it short, it's a matter of installing needed tools, cloning the main repo into the home directoy as `~/.sherpa`, adding `~/.sherpa/bin` to the path and create the SherpaCustomDir (by default in $HOME/sherpa) by dupicating '.sherpa/templates/SCD'. An optional but interesting step is to alias the 'sherpa' command as something like 's' for shorter commands.


### 1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SherpaBasecamp/sherpa.git ~/.sherpa
```

### 2. Add to the PATH




::tabs{variant="line" sync="your-scope-name"}

  ::div{label="WebInstall"}
  You can get Pathman here: [https://webinstall.dev/pathman](https://webinstall.dev/pathman)
  ```shell []
  pathman add ~/.sherpa/bin
  ```
  ::

  ::div{label="Bash"}
  If your config file is in the standard location:
  ```shell [~/.bashrc]
  # Adding ~/.sherpa/bin to the PATH
  export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.sherpa/bin"
  ```
  ::

  ::div{label="ZSH"}
  If your config file is in the standard location:
  ```shell [~/.zshrc]
  # Adding ~/.sherpa/bin to the PATH
  path+=("$HOME/.sherpa/bin")
  ```
  ::

  ::div{label="Fish"}
  If your config file is in the standard location:
  ```shell [~/.config/fish/config.fish]
  # Adding ~/.sherpa/bin to the PATH
  fish_add_path --append ~/.sherpa/bin
  ```
  ::

::

### 3. Create the default SherpaCustomDir

```bash
cp -r ~/.sherpa/templates/SCD ~/sherpa
```

### 4. Shorter sherpa Alias

::tabs{variant="line" sync="your-scope-name"}

  ::div{label="WebInstall"}
  You can get Aliasman here: [https://webinstall.dev/pathman](https://webinstall.dev/pathman)
  ```shell []
  aliasman sh sherpa
  aliasman sdd cd $HOME/.sherpa
  aliasman scd cd $HOME/sherpa
  ```
  ::

  ::div{label="Bash"}
  If your config file is in the standard location:
  ```shell [~/.bashrc]
  # Aliases for sherpa
  alias sh='sherpa'
  alias sdd='cd $HOME/.sherpa'
  alias scd='cd $HOME/sherpa'
  ```
  ::

  ::div{label="ZSH"}
  If your config file is in the standard location:
  ```shell [~/.zshrc]
  # Alliases for sherpa
  alias sh='sherpa'
  alias sdd='cd $HOME/.sherpa'
  alias scd='cd $HOME/sherpa'
  ```
  ::

  ::div{label="Fish"}
  If your config file is in the standard location:
  ```shell [~/.config/fish/config.fish]
  # Alias for sherpa
  alias sh 'sherpa'
  alias sdd 'cd $HOME/.sherpa'
  alias scd 'cd $HOME/sherpa'
  ```
  ::
  path+=("$HOME/.sherpa/bin")
  ```
