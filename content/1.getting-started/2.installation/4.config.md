The global Sh:erpa configuration is on purpose minimal so we could jump into the fun parts instead of learning how to configure the tool.

## The BaseCamp

Located in the `~/.sherpa` directory, the `basecamp.sh` file is loaded first at build-step, so that's the place where we are defining some global variables, and host a few useful little functions.

### Main Directories

Those are the default paths upon installation:

```shell
# ~/.sherpa/basecamp.sh

readonly SDD="$HOME/.sherpa"     # Sherpa Dot-Dir
readonly SCD="$HOME/sherpa"      # Sherpa Custom-Dir
```

### The Editor

By default it's Vim, and if you need a simple (singleFile) config, preconfigured for Shell and WebDev, you can grab that [Racoon on Github](https://github.com/AndiKod/racoon.vim).

```shell
# ~/.sherpa/bassecamp.sh

readonly EDITOR="vim"            # Default Editor
```
You can replace `vim` by whatever editor you are using and can open files from the console. Neovim's `nvim`, VsCode's `code` might be able to do it, or any other console based editor or alias.


## The main .yaml

In `~/.sherpa/Sherpa.yaml` we might store some config variables later, such as the default primaryColor for the styles.


## Update

Since v0.2.0 you can just run the `self-update` command: 

```shell
sherpa self-update
```

This will get the latest version from Github, then re-build the `sherpa` executable from the new source files.

## Uninstall

For the sake of completion, but secretly hoping you won't need that command :)

```shell
# Delete the Sherpa Dot Dir
rm -rf ~/.sherpa

# You can also remove the Alias
#+and revert the add to path changes.
```
