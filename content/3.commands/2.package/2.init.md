Basically like running `sherpa new <packageName>` inside an existing directory, skipping the creation of it and using the directory name as the package name.

```bash [inside an empty directory]
sherpa init
```
This command is almost here 'for the MEMES' ðŸ˜‚ as the `sh new` does the job already and it's enough.
