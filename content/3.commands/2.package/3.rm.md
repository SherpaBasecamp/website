Creating packages with ease is cool, cleaning the place as easy is a good idea.

### Remove a local Box

When a local BashBox is created via `sherpa new <myPackage>`...

- The package directory is created into ${SCD}/boxes/<myPackage>
- The built script is symlinked into ${SDD}/bin to be on the PATH
- An entry is added to ${SCD}/registers/localBoxes.yaml.

The rmBox <boxName> reverts those three operations.

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa rmBox <packageName>
```


### Remove a local Lib

To clean up in the same manner a local Lib...

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa rmLib <packageName>
```
