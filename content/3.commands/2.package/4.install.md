Sharing someting useful, original or just simple and Fun, is always a great feeling. Installing it in a breeze is another pleasure.

### Install a remote BashBox

There is also a `-t` option for the `type` of package, either _bin_ or _lib_, but since the default value is _bin_, we can skip it.

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa install -n "<name>" -u "<repoUrl>"

# Or with the sh alias
sh install -n "<name>" -u "<repoUrl>"
```

This will clone the repository into `${SCD}/bbr/bin/<name>`, build, and symlink the script into `${SDD}/bin`. Check the dashboard for the executable name to launch.

### Install a remote Lib

Almost the same as above, but the `-t` option is expected to be used, so Sh:erpa could treat the package accordingly.

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa install -n "<name>" -t "lib" -u "<repoUrl>"

# Or with the sh alias
sh install -n "<name>" -t "lib" -u "<repoUrl>"
```
