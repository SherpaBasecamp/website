To uninstall a git-installed BashBox, use the `-n` flag followed by the name of the package, as listed on the Dashboard.

This will delete the package directory from inside `$SCD/bbr`, remove symlinks and registers entries.

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa uninstall -n "<packageName>"
```

For a git-installed Library, add the `-t` type flag, with a value of "lib".

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa uninstall -n "<packageName>" -t "lib"
```
