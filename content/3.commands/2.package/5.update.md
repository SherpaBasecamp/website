Sharing someting useful, original or just simple and Fun, is always a great feeling. Installing it in a breeze is another pleasure.

### Update a Package

This will get the last version trom the remote repo, and re-build the script.

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa update <packageName>

# Or with the sh alias
sh update <packageName>
```

### Update Sh:erpa itself

In the same manner that the `update` command, this will get the freshest version of Sh:erpa and re-build the `sherpa` executable.

```bash [From anywhere]
sherpa self-update

# Or with the sh alias
sh self-update
```
