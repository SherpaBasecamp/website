Building the script with `sherpa build` then compiling it to a binary file, using the default SHC setup.

```bash[from/some/BashBoxRoot]
sherpa compile
```
You can refer to the [SHC Repo](https://github.com/neurobin/shc), but what that basically do is using C to transform the file and somehow obfuscate the source code. The resultant don't include an interpreter and still uses the system shell to run.

Most of times, the `build` comand is enough, but having that as an option is a nice thing to have in the toolbox.
