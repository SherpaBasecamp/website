Building an executable script from partials, and executing other side-quests along the trail.

```bash[from/some/bashBoxRoot] 
sherpa build
# or
sherpa b
```


On another page, the build process is described like this:

* Using the generated `src/__paths.txt`, partials will be identified
* Files sourced via `use "dir/file"` in `src/bin.sh` are added to the list
* All needed paths are combined into a single file
* Documentation is generated from that file, and placed into `docs/myScript.md`
* Comments are stripped away from the production version of the script
* Empty lines, leading and trailing spaces are also removed
* The `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang is added back at the top of the file
* The resulted file is saved as `target/local/myScript`
* Obviously also made executable along the way
* Finally a symlink is created inside `~/.sherpa/bin` for direct invocations

...and in a nutshell _(dadjoke spotted. sry)_ this is it.
