Generating markdown documantation, from shdoc and bashdoc annotations.

```bash[from/some/BashBoxRoot]
sherpa doc
#or
sh d
```

This will scan all .sh files in the src/ directory, and generate markdown documantation in the docs/ directory. We can then safely strip away all comments at build-time.

The `build, run, compile` commands will generate a single .md file named as the script itself and be placed in the docs/ dir aswell.

The top of the page, and parts above functions are handeled with [shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc), and for generic complementary annotations in other parts [bashdoc](https://github.com/dustinknopoff/bashdoc) syntax is expected.

Many thanks to the maintainers of those two tools.
