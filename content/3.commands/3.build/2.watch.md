Watching for changes inside the `dev` and `data` directories, and run `sherpa build` on file save. Don't need to run it manually after each change.

```bash[from/some/bashBoxRoot]
sherpa watch
# or
sherpa w
```

Go inside the root of the BashBox, run the command and forget about. Do your editing in another Terminal tab or editor window, and `Ctr-C` to stop it.

That command is using [watchexec](https://webinsta.dev/watchexec) and it's installed during the first install of Sh:erpa. If you don't have it, just run `webi watchexec@stable`.
