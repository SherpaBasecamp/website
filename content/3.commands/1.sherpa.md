The page that gets printed when invoked with no arguments or optional flags.

```bash
# Defalut
sherpa

# With sh alias
sh
```

So far it lists the local Boxes from `${SCD}/boxes` and the ones installed via sherpa install, Plus the links to the Docs, Github and Discord.

With some colors and font-styles, but the dashboard looks more or less llike this:

```txt

In the comming updates, there are plans to include fresh news about new Sh:erpa or Installed boxes updates available, so you could check them out. A good way to stay informed on when you can go `sh self-update` or `sh update GitGood`.
