## Better than nothing :)

This is not yey the "big bad blog" we could expect, but rather a website corner where a Changelog and some simple Articles will be published.

On Sh:erpa itself the paint is still wet, and quite some things are missing and need attention, but hey, let's tell some stories as we'll find some time for it.

Ideally, I would like to add a **Ressources** section to the website with "all things Bash", documentation, snippets, publications about _coding style_ and so on.

Anyway, come over on Discord, let's chat.
