Last major commands still missing are now available, the Options partial is updated too and the Dashboard sections completed.

## Commands, new and refactored.

One new in the familly...

### upLib

We had until now the `sherpa update` command to update an already installed BashBox, but still missing the option to update an installed library.

Instead of tweaking the uninstall command and adding flags, that time it's a separate, shorter command:

```bash
sherpa udLib <libName>
```
### uninstall ...reviewd

On the contrary, the uninstall command takes one of two flags. `-n` for the name and `-t` for the type, defaulting to _bin_.

```bash
# Uninstall an installed BashBox
sherpa uninstall -n "<boxName>"
# Uninstall an installed Library
sherpa uninstall -n "<libName>" -t "lib"
```

## --options

As of now, and I would say finally, the data printed when flags like `script --help`, `script -h` or `--version` is taken from the _Sherpa.yaml_ file, via the _package_ helper.

Something like:

```bash
# Version
br
p  "$(package "name"): v$(package "version")"
br
```
Keep up to date the Sherpa.yaml manifest and it will be reflected on the scripts's options.

## Updated Dashboard

Since we have Boxes and Libs, both local and installed, each one of them have a Homescreen section.

The bottom links are also updated to reflect the new Netlify sub-domain and github org name.
