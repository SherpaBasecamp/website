The "Road to" article is here so I can keep track of small changes and bigger ones occuring as building bricks for the next release.

No particular order, as they come to mind or gets implemented. Just two main sections, **Done** and **Planed:** with things already here and the ones worked-on. As something planned gets shipped, it will naturally be moved in the section above.

Once v0.6.0 will be out, that article will be renamed and vanish into the sunset like Clint Estwood! It will then be known as just v0.6.0

## Done!

I will normally tone it down on the "add new commands" front, as there are already enough to create some neat BashBox and Libs. Testing well enough the existant sounds like a good idea.

### 0.5.1

Custom primaryColor per project or for all local Boxes!

- To set the titles color for all local BashBoxes, the value of `primaryColor` in `SCD/Sherpa.yaml` must be set as one of the following: Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan or White.

- For a specific color per project as Blue, create a mainColor variable, before loading "std/fmt"

```bash
mainColor="Blue"
use "std/fmt"
```
- If any of those are set or the color have a typo in it, the primaryColor will fallback to Green.

## Planned

A message will be shown on the Dashboard, if a new version of Sh:erpa was pushed to Github, so the bash hikers could come here check the Changelogs before getting the shiny new thing with `sherpa self-update`.
