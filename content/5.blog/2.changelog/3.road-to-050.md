title: Road to v0.5.0

The "Road to" article is here so I can keep track of small changes and bigger ones occuring as building bricks for the next release. 

No particular order, as they come to mind or gets implemented. Just two main sections, **Done** and **Planed:** with things already here and the ones worked-on. As something planned gets shipped, it will naturally be moved in the section above.

Once v0.5.0 will be out, that article will be renamed and vanish into the sunset like Clint Estwood! It will then be known as just v0.5.0

## Done!

It's "one of those days" and the last update broke some things, so we're back on v0.4.0 from last week and re-implementing what was done. v0.4.1 will make a comeback soon enough.

### Appwrite & Teable CRUD integration

As separate libraries for now, there are two packages that lets us connect to a remote database on [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) or [Teable](https://teable.io/), and perform CRUD operation before displaying the results in the terminal.

This is a foundation for intersting things to come. Little apps with remote database perssistance and the terminal as a browser are getting real.

It works, but I just whant to clean it up a bit before linking the repos.

## Planned:

### v0.4.1

* The _src/_options__ file now use data from the _Sherpa.yaml_ manifest in the root of our BashBox via the `package` function.

When creating a new BashBox, think about customising things in the `Sherpa.yaml` file, mainly the description field and if applyable, the repo url.

Both will be used in the pages generated by commands as: 'scriptName --help' or 'scriptName --version'.

In addition to little fixes...

### BashORM

Once we have JSON data in a Bash variable, comming from any source, the goal is to filter them with jq and mimic SQL statements. WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER BY, ...

### Communication

It's ann nice, but I need to find ways to let people know about Sh:erpa.

I thought about writing an article on DEV.to or going back to check Reddit as Twitter is limitting my reach because I didn't bought the blue badge.

One way or another, we need people in Discord and playing around with Sh:erpa.
