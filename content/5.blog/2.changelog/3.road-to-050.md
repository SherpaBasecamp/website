The "Road to" article is here so I can keep track of small changes and bigger ones occuring as building bricks for the next release.

No particular order, as they come to mind or gets implemented. Just two main sections, **Done** and **Planed:** with things already here and the ones worked-on. As something planned gets shipped, it will naturally be moved in the section above.

Once v0.5.0 will be out, that article will be renamed and vanish into the sunset like Clint Estwood! It will then be known as just v0.5.0

## Done!

It actually IS finised and pushed to master, but a messed-up `git rebase` wipped out two articles and the docs update. Already late here and need some rest.

Gosh I so hate GIT sometimes ^^
