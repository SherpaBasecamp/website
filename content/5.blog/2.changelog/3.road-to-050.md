The "Road to" article is here so I can keep track of small changes and bigger ones occuring as building bricks for the next release. 

No particular order, as they come to mind or gets implemented. Just two main sections, **Done** and **Planed:** with things already here and the ones worked-on. As something planned gets shipped, it will naturally be moved in the section above.

Once v0.5.0 will be out, that article will be renamed and vanish into the sunset like Clint Estwood! It will then be known as just v0.5.0

## Done!

Hold your horses cowboy! v0.4.0 is still smoking :)

## Planned:

As always, way too much things, but we'll see...
