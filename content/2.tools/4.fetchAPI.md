The local version of something like Axios or FetchAPI, in it's—very—simplest form for the moment, but leveraging all the power that jq gives.

## Get that remote data!

Imagine having some blog type content in a headless-CMS, exposing the content as JSON endpoint. You could serve it in the terminal, as if it were a web page:

```bash
use "std/fmt"
article="https://someapi.com/post/77"

main() {
  h1 "$(fetch "$article" | jq ".title" )"
}
```

Another way to use that functionality would be abstracting the calls into a lib or a dedicated BashBox then using its functions. Nice & clean.
