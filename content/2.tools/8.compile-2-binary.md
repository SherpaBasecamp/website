For the completion sake, Sh:erpa uses [SHC](https://github.com/neurobin/shc) to transform the executable generated by `sh b` to a Binary, via the `sherpa compile` command.

The project is not quite "cutting edge" as the last official release dates back in 2019 and have some waiting PullRequests, yet SHC is almost the one popping out when we are searching for such CLI tools and indeed it works.

It will not pack an interpreter with it, still use the local bash to run but have some obfuscation, use C code, and at that stage it's more than good enough to play around with it.

That being said, in most cases you won't need it, as `sh b` produce already functional and optimised executable shell scripts, at least for what it's intended for.
