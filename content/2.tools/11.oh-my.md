## Git Based & Core + Custom

Just like Oh-my-bash, Sh:erpa is basically a Git repository, holding .sh files and tools in a specific directories hyerarchy, splitted between the main directory (the one that gets updates, SherpaDotDir) and the custom one with content that can override/extend the core (SherpaCustomDir).

## Community driven and Complementary

If Oh-My-Bash or Oh-My-Zsh are here to give superpowers when it comes to Bash configuration, prompt themes, aliases, ...Sh:erpa complete them with helping devs to stay organised and DRY when writing Bash programs/apps, or our version of plugins. When it comes to the content, everybody can join in, get creative, have a chat on Discord and share their production.

## BashBox as a community made, universal Plugin

Many OhMy plugins are essentially collections of alliases, or performing some tasks for the specific shell they are targeting ['bash', 'zsh', 'fish']. A BashBox covering the same topic and installed as a bash script on the path will be executed by any shell able to identify a `!#/usr/bin/env bash` shebang and execute it with that interpreter.
