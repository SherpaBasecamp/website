Each Sh:erpa project aka BashBox, even for little things is made of separate files per logical unit, like header, bin (main entry point), options, etc in the `src/`

## When running _sherpa build_, this will happen:

* Using the generated `src/__paths.txt`, partials will be identified
* Files sourced via `use "dir/file"` in `src/bin.sh` are added to the list
* All needed paths are combined into a single file
* Documentation is generated from that file, and placed into `docs/myScript.md`
* Comments are stripped away from the production version of the script
* Empty lines, leading and trailing spaces are also removed
* The `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang is added back at the top of the file
* The resulted file is saved as `target/local/myScript`
* Obviously also made executable along the way
* Finally a symlink is created inside `~/.sherpa/bin` for direct invocations
* If the command is `sherpa run` the terminal is cleared and script executed
* If the command is `sherpa compile`, the script is compiled to a binary
