The UNIX Philosophy is still something great. In short "Write simple programs that do one thing, and can inter-operate with the others."

Every BashBox you write and publish can be installed/used by a fellow developper to create another one, and together we can build a BashBox ecosystem.

## Comme have a chat

A little Discord server is up, so you can come and hang out together or talk about CLI life without being "the weird one" at the familly table.

That, or talk about what's comming next during the expedition. I keep a todo-list there, eventually webhooks from github repos, and forums, as the 'Community' mode is activated.

## Help editing the docs

 This documentation website is built with NuxtJS, so correcting the english version or translating to your native language will be possible.

Each page have a little `Edit page` button, so if you spot somme spelling errors (there are some, for sure) or improvements you feel like proposing on github ...you're welcome :)

## Comming next

There will be more ways to contribute or help, as I am so far a "one man orchestra" but commited to that project and determined to do what it takes to give it a chance to take off. Oh, and it will be forever Free like in Free speech!
