In `~/.sherpa/basecamp.sh` the default editor is set:

```bash
# ~/.sherpa/basecamp.sh

readonly EDITOR="vim"
```
Then, from the root directory of a BashBox:


```bash
# /some/BashBox

sherpa edit bin

# OR
sherpa e bin

# OR, with an sh alias
sh e bin
```

Any of those commands, will open `src/bin.sh` in the designated prefered editor.

Besides `bin`, you can use `opt` to edit the custom --flags and options, `yaml` for the Sherpa.yaml file in the root with the project manifest data, or `basecamp` for the general Sh:erpa config.
